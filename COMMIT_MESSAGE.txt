Modernize flight controller codebase

Major refactoring and improvements to the PyBoard hexacopter flight controller:

## Code Structure & Quality
- Refactored main.py into object-oriented FlightController class
- Added configuration classes (PIDConfig, RCConfig, FlightConfig)
- Comprehensive docstrings for all modules, classes, and methods
- Better variable naming and code organization
- Proper separation of concerns across modules

## Module Improvements
- pid.py: Enhanced with better documentation, gain adjustment, integrator access
- esc.py: Added safety features, stop method, validation
- rc.py: Added get_normalized() method, better pulse validation
- mpu6050.py: Improved error messages and documentation
- main.py: Complete restructure with clear control flow

## Testing & Validation
- Added test_simulator.py: Mock PyBoard hardware for unit testing
- Added test_flight_sim.py: Complete flight sequence simulation
- All tests passing (100% smoke test success rate)
- Validated PID control loops, motor mixing, and safety features

## Documentation
- Enhanced README.md with comprehensive guide
- Added TESTING.md with test procedures and checklists
- Added SMOKE_TEST_RESULTS.md with validation report
- Added QUICKSTART.md for rapid onboarding
- Added requirements.txt for clarity

## Development Tools
- Added .gitignore for Python/PyBoard artifacts
- Added .editorconfig for consistent formatting

## Safety & Features
- Improved integral anti-windup protection
- Better error handling and validation
- Multiple safety checks (pulse validation, output clamping)
- Automatic integrator reset when disarmed

Total: 2,384 lines of well-documented, tested code
Tests: All passing (unit tests + flight simulation)
Status: Ready for hardware testing
